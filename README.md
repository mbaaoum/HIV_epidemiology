# HIV Epidemiology Project
This project models the dynamics of HIV transmission and prevalence using computational simulations and data-driven approaches. The work includes:

Model Implementation: Developing and calibrating a system to simulate HIV trends based on CDC data, including new diagnoses and diagnosed prevalence.
Scenario Analysis: Exploring the impact of varying global transmission rates on HIV outcomes using simulations and RMSE-based model calibration.
Data Analysis: Extracting and analyzing subgroup-specific HIV diagnosis data, with a focus on age, race, and risk dimensions.
Visualization: Generating plots and histograms to compare simulated results with observed data and highlight trends across demographic groups.
Key tools and libraries used include R for modeling, ggplot2 for visualization, and custom scripts for simulation setup and calibration. The findings highlight areas for improved interventions and provide insights into epidemic trends.
